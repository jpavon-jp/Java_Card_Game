# 🃏 Java Card Game (Object-Oriented Design)

A fully functional card game developed in **Java**. This project focuses on clean **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, implementing robust game logic, deck management, and a scoring system.

## 📖 Project Overview
This application was built to demonstrate the practical application of core software engineering concepts. The architecture emphasizes modularity and reusability, featuring distinct classes for Cards, Decks, Players, and the Game Engine itself. It simulates a complete game cycle from shuffling and dealing to determining the winner based on specific rules.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎮 Core Mechanics
* **Deck Management:** Logic for shuffling, dealing, and restocking cards.
* **Player Interaction:** Management of player hands and turn-based actions.
* **Scoring System:** Algorithms to calculate points and determine win conditions.
* **Game Loop:** A robust main loop that controls the flow of the game state.

### 🏗️ Architecture & Design
* **OOP Principles:** Heavy use of **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism** to structure the game entities.
* **Scalability:** Designed to be easily extensible for different types of card games.
* **Clean Code:** Focus on readability and standard Java naming conventions.
